# Express Server Example with Docker

This is a simple example of an Express server written in Node.js. The server listens on port 3000 and handles a GET request to the root URL ('/') by logging the current date and time and sending it as a response. The server can be run locally or using Docker.

In this exercise I built a Docker image from the project and run it in a Docker container. The container maps port 3000 of the host machine to port 3000 of the container, allowing access to the server.
